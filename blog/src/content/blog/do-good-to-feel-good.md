I recently came across this organization called [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org) through some form of advertisement. Their mission caught my interest, so I decided to look them up. In essence, it's a nonprofit organization that researches the world's most pressing problems and encourages peopleâ€”particularly the younger generation, to pursue careers that can make a meaningful impact on these issues. They offer extensive resources, including career guides, advice columns, research, and even a job board to help people find high-impact careers. While this might sound like an advertisement for the organization, it's not, though I happily support their cause as it strongly aligns with my own values.

While browsing their website, I discovered that they offer a career guide in various digital formats, as well as a free paperback version-which I ordered. Since receiving the book, I've only completed the first chapter, but it was incredibly inspirational and sparked the idea for this blog. Though reading the entire book would give me more insights to share, my goal is not to simply review or summarize the book itself as you can read it yourself. Instead, I want to explore the essence of kindness and the importance of doing good for others and the world, particularly through our careers but also just as individuals navigating society.

We largely live in a world centered around capitalism, where societal expectations often predefine the structure of our lives. In developed nations, the typical path involves progressing from birth through grade school to post-secondary education (college, university, etc.), potentially followed by post-graduate studies (master's, doctorate, etc.), entering the workforce, or starting a business. The focus then often shifts to earning money for rent, bills, debt repayment, mortgages, and retirement savings, continuing until retirement and, eventually, death. While this trajectory varies from person to person, some enter the workforce right after high school, others pursue graduate education while working full-time or running a businessâ€”the underlying structure can often feel self-focused and mundane. We're conditioned to focus primarily on day-to-day necessities and only securing our own happiness, along with that of our loved ones.

This prescribed life cycle honestly sounds reasonable, and for many, it *is* adequate. Indeed, having the privilege to afford a quality education, secure a somewhat engaging job, and earn enough to cover expenses and save is significant. But this raises the question: Is this truly enough? As residents of relatively stable nations, both economically and politically, many of us possess the opportunity and resources to contribute a lot more. So is it sufficient to perpetuate this pattern of pursuing well-paying careers, often treating work merely as a necessity, solely for our personal fulfillment? The reality is, even those who successfully navigate this path, achieving financial security and personal milestones, can still experience a sense of incompleteness. So what's missing?

A common misconception I often encounter is that career dissatisfaction stems solely from doing work one doesn't enjoy or isn't passionate about. However, finding your 'passion' and being fortunate enough for it to align with a high-demand and well-compensated field is genuinely challenging. Another misconception attributes this dissatisfaction purely to insufficient income. While low pay can certainly contribute to job dissatisfaction, many highly compensated individuals still feel unfulfilled in their careers. Anecdotally, I've encountered more people dissatisfied with their jobs, ready to quit instantly, than satisfied ones, regardless of salary or alignment with this 'dream job' narrative. This brings me to a third, often-overlooked component of our careers, and in fact, our lives: impact.

Humans are inherently social creatures. Consequently, we tend to seek connection and support from one another. We frequently find happiness in contributing to the happiness of others. Strong morals and a sense of shared humanity are concepts prevalent across almost all religions, cultures, and spiritual traditions. Below are some quotes from notable figures from different backgrounds that highlight this very idea:

> "A man's true wealth is the good he does in this world." - Muhammad (p.b.u.h)

> "Set your heart on doing good. Do it over and over again, and you will be filled with joy." - Buddha

> "Love your neighbor as yourself." - Jesus Christ

> "Lifeâ€™s most persistent and urgent question is, â€˜What are you doing for others?â€™" - Martin Luther King Jr.

> "We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give." - Winston Churchill

> "Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth." - Muhammad Ali

Unsurprisingly, then, we seem geared towards finding fulfillment in positively impacting others. I believe this impact is often the missing piece in our careers and, in our lives overall. Admittedly, finding well-paying jobs within specific fields that *also* offer significant positive impact can be difficult, especially in a competitive job market. However, this difficulty shouldn't deter us from actively seeking careers that make a difference. Furthermore, meaningful impact doesn't have to originate solely from our 9-to-5; numerous avenues exist to contribute on a personal level.

As this blog isn't intended as a career guide, I won't delve into the specifics of finding a high-impact career path. Instead, my aim is to encourage reflection on the potential impact each of us can have on the world and those around us. The world is vast and complex, making it easy to take our opportunities and privileges for granted. There are parts of the world lacking access to education, grappling with starvation, or facing devastation from war and violence. Children who should be in school are forced onto the streets to earn measly incomes to help their families survive. Disputes over land and resources, often fueled by religious claims or sheer greed, remain prevalent today. In many parts of the world, poverty and lack of access to basic necessities drive people to desperation and crime.

Since it may be relevant: as a personal example, the cover photo for this blog was taken during a recent visit to my home country, Pakistan. I captured it on a deserted seashore around 7 AM in the morning. Along the shore, my uncle's family and I were the only visitors in sight. However, we noticed several individuals scattered across the beach, searching for tourists to offer activities like horse riding or dune buggy tours. The photo captures one of these men on his horse. As soon as he saw us sitting by the shore, he rushed towards us, practically pleading for one of us to take a ride so he could earn some money. While it took some persistence for me to agree, it was ultimately the desperation in his eyes that convinced me. I reflected on the fact that he was out there at sunrise, trying to secure what might be his only income for the day. The cost of that one ride was, I believe, only around 300 PKR, which is barely over a dollar in CAD. This brief experience really puts things into perspective, highlighting the privileges we often take for granted and it helped ignite the willingness in me to help others.

The scope of these global issues may seem overwhelming, but that shouldn't lead to apathy or ignorance. Instead, we should strive to contribute to solutions, because even small actions matter.

We can start by consciously practicing kindness towards those around us, through our words, actions, or simply being present for someone in need. We can also seek opportunities to give back to our communities, perhaps through volunteering, donating to charities, or advocating for social justice. And for those able, consider aligning your career path with your values to make a positive global impact. Crucially, however, and something often overlooked, is the vital importance of just staying informed. We should educate ourselves on issues extending beyond our immediate experience or community. Follow local and global politics, and exercise our right to vote. Support leaders committed to addressing important issues and hold them accountable. It's vital to recognize our collective responsibility to oppose mistreatment and injustice, regardless of where it occurs or who is affected. Staying up-to-date with current events, reading diverse perspectives, or engaging with informative content all over the internet can deepen our understanding of global struggles and propagate empathy. The information is out there; we just have to be willing to seek it, learn from it, while also critically evaluating the trustworthiness and potential biases of our sources.

Kindness is free, yet its ripple effect can extend far beyond our immediate circle. By practicing kindness and compassion, we can inspire others to do the same, generating waves of positivity and goodwill. And while kindness alone won't solve all the world's problems, it represents a crucial step forward. Whether we brighten a stranger's day with a smile or dedicate our career to aiding those in need, every positive action contributes. Importantly, this focus on positive impact benefits not only society but also ourselves. As mentioned earlier, contributing to the well-being of others often enhances our own fulfillment, reminding us that elements beyond money and passion are vital to a meaningful life and career. I hope we all strive to cultivate greater kindness, deeper compassion, and heightened awareness of the interconnected world around us. ðŸ˜Š
