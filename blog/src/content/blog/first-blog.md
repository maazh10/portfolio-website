# Why?

If I'm ever lying awake in bed at night or sitting idle on my couch on a Sunday morning, thereâ€™s usually a lot of interesting thoughts or ideas going around in my mind. It might be a personal dilemma, a world issue, a problem Iâ€™m envisioning but canâ€™t seem to find a breakthrough for, my next big project idea, or something else entirely.

There are times when I have found that sharing a thought with someone who might have an interest or an alternative perspective on it, helps spark an intellectual discussion. This often leads to better insights into the original thought, which I find beneficial. For this reason, I often refer back to recent ideas or thoughts when Iâ€™m conversing with a friend, family member, or a colleague.

I was never particularly big on writing when I was in schoolâ€”I used to despise those long creative writing assignments in English class. But as Iâ€™ve grown older, Iâ€™ve learned to appreciate the written form of communication. Iâ€™ve found that I can organize and convey my thoughts much more coherently when I write compared to when I speak.  

Getting ideas out of my head and into written words also helps clear my mental space and gives me a new perspective. For example, when tackling a complex problem, instead of overwhelming my brain with information, Iâ€™ve found it helpful to write out the context, sketch possible approaches, or explain the issue to someone else. This technique has often led to breakthroughs for me in the past.  

I have a wide range of interests and an endless curiosity to learn and educate myself about new things. I also find joy in sharing knowledge with others in areas where I might have some expertise.  

Combining these goals with the spare time I occasionally find on weekends, I decided to start this blog. I want to use this space to share interesting thoughts, opinions, ideas, solutionsâ€”whatever comes to mind.  

I don't want this blog to be confined to any single topic. It could be technical or non-technical. I might write about some random interests of mine like photography or basketball, share anecdotes from a movie I watched recently, or even explore the lyrics of a song I love.  

The possibilities are endless, but my primary aim is simple:  
- To educate, inspire, or add value to even a single personâ€™s life.  
- To use this platform as a way to explore new topics and educate myself on things I wouldnâ€™t normally dive into.

# How?

Now onto the more interesting bit. As this is my first blog post, I thought it would be fitting to start off by writing about an interesting technical problem I had to solve to get this blog up and running.

As an aspiring web developer, I love some new technical challenges and keeping myself busy with fun projects and problems.

### Context

I developed and deployed a personal portfolio website a couple of months ago which lives on the domain https://maazh.tech. This website was a standard React app, but I had built a custom CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy the web app on a Google Cloud VM. I used GitHub Actions to automate the build and deploy process.

Here's a general overview of the Github Workflow I used for the portfolio website:
- Log into Docker Hub
- Build Portfolio Docker image
- Push the Docker image to Docker Hub
- SSH into Google Cloud VM
- Pull the latest Docker image
- Take down the existing container
- Run the new container

The run step was managed through a `docker-compose.yml` which used `nginx` as a reverse proxy to serve the React app and `nginx-acme` to handle SSL certificates. This is what the old `docker-compose.yml` looked like:

```yaml
services:
  nginx-proxy:
    image: jwilder/nginx-proxy
    container_name: nginx-proxy
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ...
  nginx-proxy-acme:
    image: nginxproxy/acme-companion
    container_name: nginx-proxy-acme
    volumes:
      - ...
    environment:
      - ...
    depends_on:
      - nginx-proxy
    volumes_from:
      - nginx-proxy 
  app:
    image: ghcr.io/GHCR_USERNAME/app:latest
    container_name: app
    restart: always
    expose:
      - 80
    environment:
      - VIRTUAL_HOST=maazh.tech
      - LETSENCRYPT_HOST=maazh.tech
```

Now as I started thinking about starting a blog, the obvious choice was to just add a route to my React app and start writing. But it didn't sit right in my head to use a bloated React app to serve a blog and write my posts in `JSX`. So I did some digging and looked for some web frameworks that used static site generation and markdown files for blog posts. I settled on a framework called AstroJS for my use case after playing around with a few others.

### The Challenge
Since I had decided to use a completely separate framework for my blog, I still wanted this app to seamlessly integrate with my existing portfolio website i.e. I wanted to serve the blog on the same domain as my portfolio website, maybe under a `/blog` route link on the React app would take the user to the Astro app. This was mainly a devops heavy challenge and I started thinking about how I could achieve this.

### Naive Approach
The most naive approach I thought of was to have these apps live completely separate from each other, i.e. separate git repos, separate CI/CD pipelines, separate deployments, etc. Next, I could use a subdomain routing like `blog.maazh.tech` to route to the Astro app. But both functionally and aesthetically, I wasn't a fan of this approach and it quite literally twice as expensive to maintain, since I would have to pay for two separate VMs, maintain multiples repos and pipelines, etc. Ideally, I wanted a solution where both apps would live under my old git repo, share the same CI/CD pipeline, and be deployed on the same VM. This sounded a lot more complex for obvious reasons, since the entire devops pipeline would have to be restructured, but the end result would be a lot cleaner and more importantly cheaper!

### The Solution
So after some more thinking, research, talking to a friend, and bouncing back some ideas with ChatGPT, I discovered that this problem was easily solved using `nginx` reverse proxy by simply defining which container to route to based on the path.

So to start off, I created a skeleton Astro app in my existing git repo under a directory called `blog` and moved all the contents of my old React app except the (`docker-compose.yml` and `README`) to a `portfolio` folder. I also setup a `Dockerfile` for the new Astro app. The new folder structure looked like this:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ portfolio
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ public
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ blog
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ public
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
```

Now, all I had to do was to update the `docker-compose.yml` adding a new service for the `blog` app and the key was to add a `VIRTUAL_PATH` environment variable under this service which would be used by `nginx` to route to the correct container based on the path. The updated `docker-compose.yml` looked like this:

```yaml
services:

  nginx-proxy:
    ...

  nginx-proxy-acme:
    ...

  portfolio:
    image: ghcr.io/GHCR_USERNAME/portfolio:latest
    container_name: portfolio
    restart: always
    expose:
      - 80
    environment:
      - VIRTUAL_HOST=maazh.tech
      - LETSENCRYPT_HOST=maazh.tech

  blog:
    image: ghcr.io/GHCR_USERNAME/blog:latest
    container_name: blog
    restart: always
    expose:
      - 80
    environment:
      - VIRTUAL_HOST=maazh.tech
      - VIRTUAL_PATH=/blog
```

Finally, I just had to update the CI/CD pipeline to also build and push the `blog` image to Docker Hub. Thus the new workflow added 2 additional steps:
- Log into Docker Hub
- Build the Portfolio Docker image
- **Build the Blog Docker image**
- Push the Portfolio Docker image to Docker Hub
- **Push the Blog Docker image to Docker Hub**
- SSH into Google Cloud VM
- Pull the latest Docker image
- Take down the existing container
- Run the new container

And that's it! I now have a fully functional blog that lives under the same domain as my portfolio website. If you head over to [maazh.tech](https://maazh.tech), you will land at the same old portfolio website I had but if you go to [maazh.tech/blog](https://maazh.tech/blog), you'll see the new blog built with AstroJS. 

This was already a super fun experience for me and I can't wait to start writing more posts and sharing my thoughts on here ðŸ˜Š
