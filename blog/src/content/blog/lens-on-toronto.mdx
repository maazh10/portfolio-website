Toronto is a mesmerizing blend of modern architecture, natural beauty, and cultural diversity. Having lived here for almost 4 years now, I still find myself in awe of the city's iconic skyline and vibrant neighborhoods. Every time I spot the CN Tower in the distance, perhaps from a new perspective; I still pull out my phone to take a picture, feeling like a tourist every time.

Now, with a new professional camera and a starter lens to play around with, I took a stroll (and some drives) around the city mainly in the downtown core over the past few weeks to capture just some of the iconic landscapes of Toronto while also exploring some new ones. Then taking these RAW photos, I played around with some creative editsâ€”including masking and color grading in Adobe Lightroom to give them a unique touch.

Here I'm sharing some of my favorite shots from these outings. I've included the time of capture and tried my best to include the location (from memory) and any notable landmarks in each photo.
