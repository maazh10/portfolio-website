              <p>
                Hi, I'm Maaz! I am a software developer and recent grad based in Toronto, Ontario. I graduated from the University of Toronto in June 2024 with a major in Computer Science and I currently work as a Software Developer at Electric Mind. I was born and raised in Karachi, Pakistan and moved to Canada in 2016. I ended off middle school, and completed my high school diploma in Winnipeg, Manitoba where I spent around 6 years of my life. I moved to Toronto to attend UofT in 2021 and have been living here ever since.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have a keen interest in building innovative software and solving complex problems, particularly on the web. I have a broad range of school/professional experiences in data manipulation, automation, full-stack web development, dev-ops, as well as designing complex software architecture.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am extremely knowledge-driven, aspired by cutting-edge technologies and I'm eager to grow and use my skills to change the world someday ðŸ˜Š

              <p>
                I currently work at Electric Mind (prev. Intelliware) as a Junior Software Developer. As a student I completed two 4 month co-ops as a Software Engineer at UHN and RBC. I have experience as both a frontend and backend web developer building responsive
                sites as well as fast and optimized back-end systems and APIs. I'm also experienced in
                object oriented programming, design principles, functional programming, and software architecture.

                During my time at UofT, I served as a teaching assistant for multiple courses and have
                helped students understand complex topics in computer science such as
                object-oriented programming, software engineering principles,
                web development, and more.
