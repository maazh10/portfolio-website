              <p>
                 Hello 👋 I am a software developer and recent grad based in Toronto, Ontario. I graduated from the University of Toronto in June 2024 with a major in Computer Science and I currently work as a Software Developer at Electric Mind. I was born and raised in Pakistan and moved to Canada in 2016. I ended off middle school, and completed my high school diploma in Winnipeg, Manitoba where I spent around 6 years of my life. I moved to Toronto to attend university in 2021 and have been living here ever since. In my free time, I like to play basketball 🏀, listen to music 🎶, watch TV shows 📺, read interesting articles and blogs 📖, and explore the world 🌎.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have a keen interest in building innovative software and solving complex problems, particularly on the web. I have a broad range of school and professional experiences in full-stack web development, data transformation and manipulation, cloud automation and DevOps, networking and security, as well as designing complex software architectures. 👨🏽‍💻
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm extremely knowledge-driven, inspired by cutting-edge technologies, and I'm eager to grow and utilize my skills to make a positive impact on the world. ✨

              <p>
                I currently work at Electric Mind (prev. Intelliware) as a Junior Software Developer. As a student I completed two 4 month co-ops as a Software Engineer at UHN and RBC. I have experience as both a frontend and backend web developer building responsive
                sites as well as fast and optimized back-end systems and APIs. I'm also experienced in
                object oriented programming, design principles, functional programming, and software architecture.

              <h3>Teaching Assistant</h3>
              <p>
                During my time at UofT, I served as a teaching assistant for multiple courses and have
                helped students understand complex topics in computer science such as
                object-oriented programming, software engineering principles,
                web development, and more.
